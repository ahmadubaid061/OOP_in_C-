# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Lab Tasks Repository

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-100%25-blue?logo=c%2B%2B)

This repository contains all my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab tasks and assignments implemented in C++. The repository follows a structured approach to learning OOP concepts through practical implementation.

## 📚 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lab sessions, each focusing on specific OOP concepts:

### **Core OOP Concepts**
- **lab 1 intro** - Introduction to OOP and C++ basics
- **lab 2 structures** - Structures in C++ OOP
- **lab 3 access specifier & constructors** - Access modifiers and constructor types
- **lab 4 deep vs shallow copy** - Copy constructor and memory management
- **lab 5 const,static,mutable** - Special keywords and their usage
- **lab 6 friend class, friend function** - Friend concept in OOP

### **Advanced OOP Features**
- **lab 7 operator overloading** - Operator overloading implementation
- **lab 8 inheritance** - Inheritance and its types (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)
- **lab 9 polymorphism(overriding)** - Function overriding and runtime polymorphism
- **lab _11 Abstract class** - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions

### **C++ Standard Library & Templates**
- **lab _10 stl** - Standard Template Library (STL) in C++
- **01 STL/lists of integers** - List manipulation using STL
- **lab _12 templates in C++** - Template classes and functions
- **cout_cin overloading** - Overloading stream insertion and extraction operators

### **Special Topics & References**
- **call by reference** - Reference parameters and their usage
- **classes** - Class attributes and methods implementation
- **structure** - Basic structure implementations in C++
- **mid lab** - Mid-term lab assignments
- **00Final lab** - Final lab comprehensive tasks
